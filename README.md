<h1>Photoshop-Box-and-Array-Generator</h1>
=================================
<p>A hacked together photoshop script in javascript that generated a box and then creates and array from the box. It then adds guides based around the generated boxes. Use with the "guides to slices" tool to create a space for designing UI. Requires an open document with a canvas size larger then what the generated square will be.</p>

<h2>Templater Workflow</h2>
<p>Icon_Templater_Photoshop_Script.jsx Asks user for a square space to design icons in and then duplicates the area with a user inputted amount of rows and columns. It then outlines the squares with guides.
