Photoshop-Box-and-Array-Generator
=================================

A hacked together photoshop script in javascript that generated a box and then creates and array from the box. It then adds guides based around the generated boxes. Use with the "guides to slices" tool to create a space for designing UI. Requires an open document with a canvas size larger then what the generated square will be.
